This repo is a working multisite deployed on netlify and built using Gatsby. Navigating to the url below will serve you one of 3 gatsby sites at random. The sites were setup this way primarilly for novelty (In other words, I couldn't decide between the themes. Decisions are hard lol). Two of sites are backed by Netlify CMS and built via stackbit. The third one was built off gatsby-casper-ghost starter and modified for netlify. Each site is on a different branch. 

**WIP**: I need to clean up the readme's and the directory structure.
